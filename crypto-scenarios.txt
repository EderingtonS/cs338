1. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a key K, which alice encrypts as AES(K, M) to send to Bob who decrypts the ciphertext C using AES(K, C). They secretly agree on a key and then use it to exchange a message Eve cannot decrypt.

2. Alice takes the hash of her message H(M) and uses her secret key to encrypt that E(S_A, H(M)), which she concatenates to the end of her message and sends to Bob. Bob can decrypt the signature by using E(P_A, E(S_A, H(M))) to get H(M) and compare that against his attempt at hashing the message to see if there have been any changes.

3. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a key K. She then prepares her message as AES(K, M). She then hashes her name H(A) and encrypts it with her secret key E(S_A, H(A)). She concatenates that onto the end of her AES encrypted message and sens them to Bob. Bob gets the message encoded in a way only the two of them can read, as well as a hashed name Alice that only she can send.

4. Alice could claim that C was the pdf file for a contract with another group, and so they had the digital signature for that file together without having to figure out her secret key, and could impersonate her and send it.
      Alice could claim that
