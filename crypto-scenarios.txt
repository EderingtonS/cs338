1. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a key K, which alice encrypts as AES(K, M) to send to Bob who decrypts the ciphertext C using AES(K, C). They secretly agree on a key and then use it to exchange a message Eve cannot decrypt.

2. Alice takes the hash of her message H(M) and uses her secret key to encrypt that E(S_A, H(M)), which she concatenates to the end of her message and sends to Bob. Bob can decrypt the signature by using E(P_A, E(S_A, H(M))) to get H(M) and compare that against his attempt at hashing the message to see if there have been any changes.

3. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a key K. She then prepares her message as AES(K, M). She then hashes her name H(A) and encrypts it with her secret key E(S_A, H(A)). She concatenates that onto the end of her AES encrypted message and sens them to Bob. Bob gets the message encoded in a way only the two of them can read, as well as a hashed name Alice that only she can send.

4. Alice could claim that C was the pdf file for a contract with another group, and so they had the digital signature for that file together without having to figure out her secret key, and could impersonate her and send it. Feasible.
      Alice could claim that Bob had simply forged the digital signature by somehow figuring out her secret key, which would be highly unlikely.
      Alice could claim that the message transfer had been changed by a solar storm, flipping bits and just so unfortunately happening to change her message and signature from her version to Bob's version. Incredibly unlikely.

5. Sig_CA would be E(S_CA, H("bob.com" || P_B)) which could be decrypted by applying E(P_CA, E(S_CA, H("bob.com" || P_B))) to get H("bob.com" || P_B), which Bob could check against his own has of "bob.com" || P_B.

6. No, however, any future messages must come from the S_B paired with the P_B. Only Bob has his secret key S_B, so only he could use the key-pair with P_B to send the message.

7. Mal can send her own public key in with "bob.com" to get certified for it, then she has everything she needs to present the certificate and pretend to be Bob to alice. Mal could also easily eavesdrop, as Bob receiving the certificate includes the P_B as plaintext.
