1.a. Immediately  on opening the site, I only see 1 cookie, with the name theme and a value of "default" for css338.jeffondich.com/. 

1.b. When I switched the Theme to Blue, the cookie's value changed to "blue" as well. Additionally, the time created, expiration time, and last accessed time all were replaced with new values.

1.c. Inspecting sends a GET request which includes a header that sends the coookie Theme="default". I can also edit the cookie before I send it, to change colors that way. The reponse to changing cookies is a Set-Cookie header which is followed up with the coookie's name=new value for the cookie and then all the metadata with it. Same as the inspector, except the times are all different of course. There's also a Vary: Cookie header which is probably just saying the cookie has changed.

1.d. My theme from specifically the normal browser (not burpsuite's) is still the same. Hooray!

1.e. When the browser sends a GET request, it includes a header that sends the cookie associated with the site, in this case the theme=blue cookie. That tells the server to use the blue theme.

1.f. When I request to change themes, the browser sends a GET request for the page again this time including a ?theme=blue in the file path. When the server responds, it sends back the site information with an additional Set-Cookie header which includes the cookie's new value and all the updated metadata.

1.g. Triple clicking on the value area for the cookie let me set its value to red, and then refreshing the page gave me the red theme.

1.h. Inspecting sends a GET request which includes a header that sends the coookie Theme="default". I can also edit the cookie before I send it, to change the value of the theme cookie to red.

1.i. I was using Kali, so from my root directory into /.mozilla/firefox/at1bi6gy.default-esr there are some files with the name cookie. (cookies.sqlite and cookies.sqlite-wal). cookies.qslite is a SQLite database, wall cookies.sqlite-wal is empty.
