My kali computer uses port 13

The client needs a port since both sides need to be able to send and receive information.

SYN means synchronization, and is used to synchronize communication between the client and server.
ACK means aknowledgement of the latest received package. This is used to make sure both client and server know what information the other has received.

My client initiated the termination (Marked by FIN). It comes from my IP address and goes to the IP address of the server.

Get jeff-square-colorado.jpeg makes me pretty confident this was when it was requested.


Questions:
When the client requests the jpegs, is that an "oh these are missing, I'll ask for them" or does the server say "If you are missing these, tell me".
